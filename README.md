Contains instances of PCGTSP (*.pcgtsp)

Category - All example with precedence constraints (In each instance, all parts have precedence constraints):
- p - Category (precedence constraints);
- (Number)x - In this library, contour nesting is designated "Nx", where N is the nesting degree, for example, "3x" means that the instance will contain at least one part with a hole inside parts with a hole;
- j/k/e - The criterion for the number of contours was developed to analyze the influence of the number of contours on the operation of algorithms:
1.	30 - 100 contours – j;
2.	100 – 250 contours – k;
3.  Exact algorithms - e.
- _(Number) - instance number. If the postscript "a" is indicated, then about two times less points were created in the instance (For PCGTSP).  

Category - Combined parts (In each instance there are parts with precedence constraints, as well as without a constraints):
- с – Category (сombined parts);
- j/k - The criterion for the number of contours was developed to analyze the influence of the number of contours on the operation of algorithms:
1.	30 - 100 contours – j;
2.	100 – 250 contours – k.
- (Number)x - In this library, contour nesting is designated "Nx", where N is the nesting degree, for example, "3x" means that the instance will contain at least one part with a hole inside parts with a hole;
- _(Number) - instance number. If the postscript "a" is indicated, then about two times less points were created in the instance (For PCGTSP).  

Category - Cutting techniques (Contains instances for applying non-standard cutting techniques to them):
- t – Category (сutting techniques);
- j/k - The criterion for the number of contours was developed to analyze the influence of the number of contours on the operation of algorithms:
1.	30 - 100 contours – j;
2.	100 – 250 contours – k.
- (Number)x - In this library, contour nesting is designated "Nx", where N is the nesting degree, for example, "3x" means that the instance will contain at least one part with a hole inside parts with a hole;
- _(Number) - instance number. If the postscript "a" is indicated, then about two times less points were created in the instance (For PCGTSP).  

Category - No precedence constraints (In each instance, all parts do not have precedence constraints):
- s – Category (no precedence constraints (solid));
- c/nc - Convex outer contours/ Non-convex outer contours;
- j/k/e - The criterion for the number of contours was developed to analyze the influence of the number of contours on the operation of algorithms:
1.	30 - 100 contours – j;
2.	100 – 250 contours – k.
3.  Exact algorithms - e.
- _(Number) - instance number. If the postscript "a" is indicated, then about two times less points were created in the instance (For PCGTSP).
